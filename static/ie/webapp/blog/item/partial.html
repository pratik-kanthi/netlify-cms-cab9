                        relationships
                        as Autocab customers are by in large loyal and have always supported the growth of the

                        <br><br>
                        This is our first blog post and we felt it appropriate to break our silence on the
                        disappointing news that Uber have acquired Autocab. But before we share our thoughts,
                        let’s get our vested interest out in the open so this blog can be taken as a serious opinion
                        on a tragic event that continues to erode the private hire industry.
                        <br><br>
                        A few years ago, we created a product called Cab9 which was born from our passion to
                        provide private hire operators with the technology to win, retain and grow their customer
                        base in the changing marketplace being driven by app providers. Today, we have 120+
                        customers in the UK market using our software and dispatching vehicles with compliance
                        to ensure passenger safety comes first.
                        <br><br>
                        Whilst doing our market assessment in 2016, before building our product, we identified
                        that the inferior technical capabilities, poor aesthetics and the lack of intuitiveness
                        provided by software platforms out there has left the private hire and taxi operators
                        exposed to be challenged by Uber’s easy to use suite of products. We firmly believe
                        Autocab is one of those platforms. Nevertheless, even while talking to the Autocab
                        customers, we have always refrained from capitalising on negativity as we have all had a
                        common goal of letting this industry thrive. But not today. All the years spent fighting for our businesses and livelihoods has come down to this.
                        <br><br>
                        The news that Autocab has been sold to Uber is like ‘someone letting the fox into the
                        henhouse’. This deal can only lead to further devastation in the private hire industry,
                        starting with Autocab customers. The private hire industry must stand together more than
                        ever before in order to exist and sustain, globally. Autocab’s decision to sell out to Uber
                        whose strategy is direct to driver and ambition is to operate driverless cars is very
                        surprising given that without the private hire operators and drivers, there isn’t much of an
                        industry really.</p>
                    <h4 class="mt40 mb16">Conclusion</h4>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Competition is always good. It’s good for market dynamics and consumers. Big money
                        taking over an industry putting thousands of people out of work and millions of
                        passengers at risk of safety is NOT good.
                        <br><br>
                        This news means our responsibilities as a dispatch software provider are even greater now
                        and we need to simply double down on our development investment in Cab9. With that in
                        mind, we are also launching work share on Cab9 today, ahead of our planned release date
                        of 20th of August.
                        <br><br>
                        The way passengers consume private and business mobility is changing. With the global
                        taxi apps disrupting the industry, it is imperative for operators to adapt quickly and
                        decisively to meet the challenge this presents. At Cab9, we will continue to empower
                        our clients with an innovative solution that allows them to offer an experience tantamount
                        to the likes of multinationals and create for them a fair opportunity to compete in their
                        local consumer and business market.

                        Cab9 system supports three different fare payment options i.e. cash, credit card and On Account. The passenger app is integrated with Stripe and Judopay to facilitate quick and no-hassle payment completion. The upfront pricing model shows a passenger their fare even before they make the booking, so they are aware of exactly how much they would have to pay and can choose their payment method accordingly. In case of business bookings, the payment can be pre-authorised and invoiced directly to the concerned corporate account.

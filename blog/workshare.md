Cab9’s workshare allows companies to build a competitive network of ground transport solutions across the UK, with Cab9’s dispatch software, which enables companies to easily increase customer satisfaction and add value to their business.
<br />
<br />
The workshare solution is quick and simple to set up, build a company profile and then search for companies to work with. Service levels are easy to view alongside pricing tools to ensure a sound business partnership.
<br />
<br />
Workshare allows companies to build a nationwide virtual fleet, which can be allocated bookings in two clicks of a mouse via the Cab9 dispatch screen. If a company wants more customers or needs to fill quiet times and increase bookings, then workshare is their answer.
<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Workshare Profile Setup 
<div class="mt-4">
This section provides a company the opportunity to sell themselves to other potential Cab9 partners. There is an element of free text to describe the company and the service they offer, as well as typical contact information and a document repository.
</div>
<br />
<br />

##### 1. Create a Company profile
<p class="mt-2 text-base">
This area allows you to promote your company to other potential partners using Cab9. There is an area to add a full company description, which should be used to explain the business model, history and service level. There are also fields for social media links and department contacts (finance, service and general). Most importantly, you can share your local authority licensing details in this section.
</p>

##### 2. Live Drivers 
<p class="mt-2 text-base">
This section allows you to either show or hide live drivers to prospective partners on your page. Only companies who opt-in to this feature will be able to view live drivers and will also have their own drivers shared with other prospective partners. This will help partners make a more informed choice when choosing to partner with each other.
</p>

##### 5. Document repository
<p class="mt-2 text-base">
This area allows you to upload any documents your partners may find useful to view. Typically this would include an operator’s licence so all partners know they are working with a correctly licensed company.
</p>
<br />

##### 6. Partner Management 
<p class="mt-2 text-base">
This section offers an overview of companies who have been selected as live partners. You can view driver numbers, a booking tally and the number of vehicles in their fleet. Also, you can switch partnerships off and on in this area.

##### 7. Pricing
<p class="mt-2 text-base">
This section allows a company to advertise their specific pricing rates for the service offering they provide. A company can use their default pricing model or create one specifically for workshare. In partner discovery, companies will be able to enter routes and select specific service offerings and view the actual price of the journey.

#### Partner Discovery
<div class="mt-4">
The discovery section allows companies to search for potential partners based on their geographical location and profile data. The section is divided into three areas, an interactive map, partner cards - offering a company overview and a search bar. All of these can be filtered by driver numbers, service offering and driver numbers to allow a company to research at a granular level if required. 
<br />
<br />
Once a company has narrowed down their search criteria, they can click on a company card to access that particular company's full profile and use this data to form a decision on whether to reach out to form a partnership or not.
<br />
<br />
If a company decides they want to form a partnership, they simply need to click a button and a request will be automatically sent from the system inviting them to collaborate. 
</div>
<br />
<br />

#### Partner Requests
<div class="mt-4">
There is a section within Cab9 that allows partners to keep a log of all partner requests, both inbound and outbound, which are stored within this area until either acceptance on decline.  
</div>
<br />
<br />

#### Summary
<div class="mt-4">
During the entire process, Cab9 Workshare allows all partners to view the booking progress, ensuring satisfaction and reassurance to all concerned. It is important to note, all text and email messages to the end client will show from the originating company, prompting client loyalty. Cab9 also receives 50p per booking when Workshare is employed.
